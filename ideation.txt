We are trying to create a Soda Can 3D rotation effect using CSS Only

Major help for this project: https://youtu.be/ymuBowcODVU
--------------
1. A bottle of soda is made of 2 ingradients
2. The first one is the bottle itself
3. The second one is the cover photo
4. For cover photo, you can use any photo, but for Martial arts of rotatin, we need a suitable Image
5. first, we will visit https://www.freepik.com/
6. enter keyword > soda mockup
7. select the image you like, remove background image
8. select CROP feature, cut out all excess space on the photo
9. once completed, download the image as .png file
10. Now, we will create a HTML file, and add start coding
--------------
After completing the mockup image setup
1. we will insert the product cover image upon the product mockup image

How to make the soda bottle rotate
1. when we instert image into the mockup, The image is repeating infinitely
2. we don't see it because it is outside the element's size range
3.So, If I ant to see a different area of image, I just need to move it to a certain distance, right?
4. So, we will use CSS transform property to move the image to a certain distance
5. In the background property, there are 2 values that represent the left and top distance of the image from the element
6. their default value is 0
7. we will change the value to 100px, so that the image will move 100
--------------
If we try to create a hover effect on product the soda can rotates as follow:
1. Github repo: https://github.com/HoanghoDev/youtube_v2/tree/main/3d%20Rotate%20CSS%20Only
2. In default state: we will hide the 2nd soda can
3. On hover, we will hode the 1st soda can
